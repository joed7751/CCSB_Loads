I'm attaching entire 11452600 records of:
1)  gh corrected 
2)  discharge corrected (NOTE: from "Contains  stage/Q ONLY - WORK "DD"; not the published discharge time series which it sounds like you already have).
NOTE: For GH the only time period we published was for 3/5/14 to 5/1/14;  ie just 28 days. We actually approved the entire 2014 wy.  
I'll have to look some more into this as I see published DV's for 2014 wy starting 3/1/14 (not 3/5) and ending 4/30/14.  (Many days wer 0.0 flow but these were the only days with data).  All days for all years  
for discharge for 11452600 were published as estimated due to thetime of travel issues.)

All other published discharge data we just used discharge unit values copied from 11452500 with the 2 hr time offset and all values (uv's and dv's ) flagged as estimated.
As I recall we may have just used the stage/discharge rating for those 28 days because we felt this was more valid than the Yolo time offset .
I could look up a more detailed explanation but essentially  we had a number of issues with stage record at 1452600 all years including significant backwater issues.
Comparing peak timing at the two sites and using an algorithm may still be valid in many cases and more valid than the 2-hour offset method we used.  
I think you do need to consider whether or not the CCSB was full or empty or somewhere in between in adjusting time of travel. For 2014 there was no flow over the weir 
so I suspect that was one reason why we considered stage/q rating valid.

#These objects of class "loadReg" are created.
#A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. 
#These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.
#When the models are run (m1-m9), the output will be in the console. These are the stats used to select the best model.

#Lines 75 and 77 create data frames that use the function predLoad. 
#Description of predLoad: Estimate loads from a rating-curve model from loadReg for a new data frame, aggregating the loads by specified time periods.
#Lines 76 and 78 write the data frames to a .csv file. Important note: The file must be intentionally saved as a CSV file- type ".csv" at the end when prompted.
#file.choose() lets the user select the location for the .csv files.
